### Date created
This project has been created during June 2020.

### Project Title
**Explore US bikeshare data**

### Description
The project consists in creating a tool by using **Python** to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States:
* Chicago
* New York City
* Washington

The purpose of this project has been to learn how to code in **Python**, as well as to use some essential libraries for Data Science, such as **NumPy** and **Pandas**.

Essentially, I have created a program to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. It also includes a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

#### Statistics computed

1. **Popular times of travel**
    * most common month
    * most common day of the week
    * most common hour of day


2. **Popular stations and trip**
    * most common start station
    * most common end station
    * most common trip from start to end


3. **Trip duration**
    * total travel time
    * average travel time


4. **User info**
    * counts of each type
    * counts of each gender (only available for *NYC* and *CHI*)
    * earliest, most recent and most common year of birth (only available for *NYC* and *CHI*)


### Files used
The project has been developed in the file **bikeshare.py**.

This file makes use of the following three city dataset files:
* __chicago.csv__
* __new_york_city.csv__
* __washington.csv__
